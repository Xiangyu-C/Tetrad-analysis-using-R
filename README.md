# Tetrad-analysis-using-R
Build a tetrad analysis app using R as the back end language.
Right now, I have written the script to read a csv file containing tetrad dissection data for two markers and analyze the PD, NPD, and TT distribution after deleting tetrads with at least one dead spore.
I have also built the ui in Shiny and the script to populate an editable data table with dimensions defined by user input.
